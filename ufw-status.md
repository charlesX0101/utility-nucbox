# UFW Status Report â€“ utility-nuc

## Description
This file presents the firewall posture of the utility-nuc server (GMK NucBox G5) at the conclusion of Phase Two. 
UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is configured with a default-deny stance, allowing only outbound traffic by default. 
Inbound rules are restricted to specific services and only permitted from the management VLAN (10.0.20.0/24). 
This snapshot demonstrates the rack-ready security state of the node.
